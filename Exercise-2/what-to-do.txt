This file will detail what you need to do within this exercise. It's a little more involved than the 
previous exercise, and will require some thinking and the use of another tool called 'awk'.

Like the previous tutorial, we will introduce a number of new commands and provide a brief description of 
what they do. You can always find out further detail about these commands with a simple google search. 
This exercise will act as a bridge between general bash/linux programming and more niche uses for my 
particular purposes.

As such, we want to end up with a file which we will call 'script.sh'.

1. Prior to creating a script to do this task, we are going to run this all through the command line so 
as to get an idea of what we are actually asking the script to do. The following steps will take us through
this process. 
    a) Create 10 directories, named Simulation_1, Simulation_2 and so on, up to Simulation_10.
    b) Copy the files 'md.lmp', 'run.job', 'input.xml', 'data.lmp' and 'ipi.xyz' into EACH directory.
    c) Within Simulation_1, edit the following:
        i) run.job: Change all 'XXX' to the directory name.
        ii) md.lmp: Change all 'XXX' to the directory name.
        iii) input.xml: Change all 'XXX' to the directory name, change all 'YYY' to a random number between 
        1-100000. 

This needs to be completed for all directories that we just created! That's a lot of manual, repititive work 
that we could avoid doing through the use of bash iteration and scripting!

2) Try 1) again, this time using iteration through the CLI rather than manually for each directory. You will 
need to use another command we have not encountered yet, 'sed'. I'll detail this whenever we get here.

3) Try 1) again, this time using a bash script, which we will call 'script.sh'.
