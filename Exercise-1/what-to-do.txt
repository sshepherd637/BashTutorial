This file will detail what you need to do within this exercise. It isn't extremely long, but will
hopefully touch on useful aspects of bash and the linux shell, before we move onto interacting with 
bash via scripting. 

This tutorial will introduce a number of different commands and a brief description of what they do.
Some of them will be useful, others you may not touch again within your projects. You can always find
out further detail about these commands with a simple google search. 

We will start off with some basics, and then move onto some more involved ways to interact with the 
shell. 
####################################################################################################

1. Create a file, called example.txt. Open the file using vim and write a few short sentences about your
project or modules, and move it into a directory called example_dir.

2. Copy example.txt to another file, called copied.txt.

3. Output the contents of the file to the shell using the following commands.
    a) $ cat copied.txt
    b) $ head copied.txt 
You may not have noticed a difference between the above, depending on how long the original file was. 
    a) will output the entirity of the file.
    b) will by default output the first 10 lines of the file.

4. Repeat the above, this time we will redirect the output to another file, called piped.txt, we achieve 
this through the use of `>>`.
