# BashTutorial

## Overview
This tutorial has been written to help students transition from non-coding/limited coding backgrounds to help quickly acclimitise to the use of bash through the terminal. This is not intended to cover specific HPC clusters and components that are more unique to them, rather provide a good starting block to begin exploring these facilities properly.

### Exercise 1
A simple introduction to the shell and bash to manipulate/interact with the shell. 

### Exercise 2
An exercise into scripting and preparing scripts to complete repetitive tasks.

### Exercise 3
An introduction to data parsing and visualisation without the use of python.
